/**
 * This class provides a test fixture to use for the 'Computer Game' project in Introduction to Programming.
 * It creates a simple network of two countries and seven cities, which can be used for automated testing using JUnit.
 *
 * Alleviates the problem of creating a Map<City, List<Road>> yourself.
 *
 * Simply drag this file into your BlueJ-project. 
 * You can then right-click on this class and choose 'Test Fixture to Object Bench' to create the necessary test objects.
